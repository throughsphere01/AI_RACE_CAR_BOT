The Backbone of the project is reinforcement learning.
Starting from the lectures of David Silver on Reinforcement Learning.(https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ)
In this we learned what are the techniques used in reinforcement , the use of Markov Decision process and epsilon greedy policy.
Then We had the first interaction with cohding with a youtube series(https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDezJFIOU5wDdfy4e9vdnx-7)
In this we leearned how to explore and exploit the enviroment using python and Q-tables.
Then we built our first Custom Environment using deep q leraning with the help of (https://youtu.be/bD6V3rcr_54)
Then there was our first assignment of coding to create an environment.
